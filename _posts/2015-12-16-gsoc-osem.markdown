In the FOSS community it's quite normal to work together with people that are distributed all over the world. Many developers just know each other through the internet. One great chance to meet people you just know so far from the internet in real life are open source conferences. To manage the organisation process openSUSE developed the Open Source Event Manager (OSEM). The goal of this project is to extend OSEM with a dashboard for conference organizers.
