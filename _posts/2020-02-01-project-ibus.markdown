Project Title: Merge cloud input feature into ibus-libpinyin

Description: We had a GSoC project about integration cloud pinyin in ibus-libpinyin at 2018. A student got this project and achieved this feature. The code is at https://github.com/openSUSE/ibus-libpinyin. But it was not merged to upstream due to some special demands and methods. We hope somenone can finally finish this project and merge this feature to upstream.
What is ibus? The full name of ibus is Input Bus Introduction. It is the default input method framework in SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE GNOME Desktop. ibus-pinyin and ibus-libpinyin work on ibus. ibus and its input method are very important to Asia users of SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE.

Deliverable: Please work on github. We will test you code. If it's stable, we can help you to merge it to upstream.
