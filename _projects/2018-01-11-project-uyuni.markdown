Uyuni is a configuration and infrastructure management tool that saves you time and headaches when you have to manage and update tens, hundreds or even thousands of machines. Uyuni is a fork of Spacewalk that leverages Salt, React, Cobbler and containers to modernize it. Our documentation is written in AsciiDoc with the Antora toolchain and managed as code (in a git repository, with pull requests, reviews, etc). Uyuni is the upstream for SUSE Manager.
