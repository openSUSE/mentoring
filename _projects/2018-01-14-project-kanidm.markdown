Kanidm is an Identity Management system - it stores the information for people, accounts, systems and groups, to allow authentication and security decisions to be made for infrastructure. This can range from website single sign on, to wifi authentication, to ssh on linux servers.

Due to the nature of Identity Management the system must span a broad range of topics. From web userinterfaces and human interaction, social and cultural research to ensure we respect all identities we store, to security and hardening to prevent exploits, and high performance systems to support thousands of operations per second. There is a new challenge for everyone within the project!
