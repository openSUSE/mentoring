Phoeβe (/ˈfiːbi/) wants to add basic artificial intelligence capabilities 
to the Linux OS.

System-level tuning is a very complex activity, requiring the knowledge and 
expertise of several (all?) layers which compose the system itself, how they 
interact with each other and (quite often) it is required to also have an 
intimate knowledge of the implementation of the various layers.

Wouldn't it be awesome if the machine could auto-tune itself and provide a 
self-healing capability to the user? Well, if that is enough to trigger your 
interest then this is what Phoeβe aims to provide.
