# openSUSE Developer Mentoring Program
openSUSE is a community project to promote the use of Linux everywhere!
We believe that the best results come from people collaborating and having fun.

This project is our approach to centralize a collection of project ideas for
programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/), [Rails Girls Summer of
Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) or [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/).

## Development
This site is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

### Adding a new project
1. Copy a project file from the `_projects` folder (please note that the date in the filename sets the order of projects on the page)
2. Fill the fields in the copied file accordingly
3. Install the ruby bundle `bundle install`
4. Run `jekyll serve` and check in the browser on `0.0.0.0:4000` if the site looks like expected
5. Send a Pull Request

7. Get an github project admin to add a label to your issues that is called like your project
