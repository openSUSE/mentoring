# openSUSE Developer Mentoring Program

openSUSE is a community project to promote the use of Linux everywhere! We believe that the best results come from people collaborating and having fun. Our approach is to centralize a collection of project ideas for programs like Google Summer of Code, Rails Girls Summer of Code or Outreachy. 

## Mentor
### What makes a good mentor?
We carefully picked some guidelines for mentoring! We strongly recommend our mentors to read them for more information about becoming a mentor: [Guidelines by FLOSS manuals](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/), [Mentoring.org](http://www.mentoring.org/downloads/mentoring_413.pdf), [Gnome mentoring guidelines](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/docs/summer-of-code-mentoring-howto/), [KDE mentoring guidelines](https://community.kde.org/Mentoring). 

Furthermore, these are some skills and values we look for:
* Time, time and time! Don't underestimate that mentoring is a time consuming task.
* Being a FOSS evangelist and already part of an openSUSE project!
* Have a clear vision of your mentoring project!
* Having strong organization skills because you have to manage your Mentee and your daily life.

### Adding a mentoring project
If you want to add a mentoring project, please follow this workflow:

1. Is your openSUSE project already listed on our projects site? If not, please contact first our [team]() and ask to add your project. Let's create awareness about our past, present and future projects!

2. Go to our GitHub repository and add a [new issue](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues) for your project. Please use this template:

  **Project Title:** Project title, short enough to catch attention
  
  **Description:** General information about the project, avoid one Liners, the description should be as detailed as possible.
  
  **Deliverable:** Expectations from the student at the end of the project
  
  **Mentor:** Who is the mentor? Who is the Co-Mentor? Also please assign the issue to the mentor!
  
  **Skills:** Which skills are needed? Programming languages, frameworks, concepts etc.  
  
  **Skill Level:** Easy, Medium, Hard
  
  **Get started:** Tasks that mentors may want to suggest students so that they can start contributing to the code base (e.g. junior jobs, low hanging fruits, discussion on the mailing list)

3. Label the issue with your projects name (e.g. Machinery) and assign it to yourself. It will now magically appear on our [project site]()!

4. Wait till a Mentee gets in touch with you! 

## Mentee

You want to start working on a mentoring project? Awesome! Just pick one of the proposed project from our issue list and follow the get started instruction. Please also write a short comment in the issue that you would like to work on this project.

### Google Summer of Code
1. Check if you're eligible for GSoC on the official [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) website!

2. Select one of our mentoring projects or propose one to our [Administration team]()!

3. Get in touch with the mentor and follow the get started instructions in the project description! Please also write a short comment in the project issue that you would like to work on this project.

4. Write an awesome project proposal and submit it to Google Melange!

  To get started, this is a template how you could structure your proposal:
  
    **Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? Then you should conclude with a sentence or two about your solution. This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.
        
    **Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. “Future developments” can be mentioned, but your promise for the three months of the Google Summer of Code season is what counts. At this point you are making a commitment.
        
    **Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier. You don’t need to provide a lot of technical details, but you do need to show that you understand the technology and illustrate key technical elements of your proposed solution in reasonable detail.
        
    **Timeline:** This section is easily overlooked, yet it’s arguably more important than the previous section. With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. If your timeline is reasonable and its deadlines achievable, you show that you have an actual plan on how to go from idea to delivery. With this section you set expectations, so do not make promises you can’t keep. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains. Mentors are often among the top professionals in their field, and they can easily spot unrealistic timelines.
        
    **About me:** Write a few lines about you and provide contact information
  
  (Thanks to Teo Mrnjavac for the awesome [blog article](http://teom.org/blog/kde/how-to-write-a-kick-ass-proposal-for-google-summer-of-code/))
  
  There are plenty of blog articles out there how to write a good GSoC proposal. Don't worry, you don't have to stick to this template one by one. Contact your mentor early and to get to know his expectations. Just copy and paste the description from the mentoring project issue won't work!

5. Code the summer away!

6. Achieve the ultimate goal!
